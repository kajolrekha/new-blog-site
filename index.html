            <h3>1. Pick your destination</h3>
            <p>If you are wondering how to plan a trip with friends or family than you should probably start from either some stunning pics that gone viral on social media, the scenic setting of a movie, or an irresistible story of a friend’s last trip abroad. Touring plans, more often than not, are triggered by external factors.</p>
            <h4>Things to keep in mind before selecting a destination
            </h4>
            <ul>
                <li>There’s nothing to say when a traveler’s mind wishes to visit the beaches, mountains, or a forest. However, picking the right destination according to the season is a key factor in understanding how to plan a trip successfully.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Check out the best time to visit all destinations. Usually, the ideal season to visit beaches and mountains is completely different.</li>
                    <li>Consider the cost factor while picking a destination. Some places are more enjoyable in a luxury budget than others. Going to a luxury destination during the shoulder season (a few weeks before or after the official ‘busy season’) can result in some good discounts on hotels and flights.
                    </li>
                    <li>Safety of travelers is a prime concern people specially when you are concerned of how to plan a family vacation. Pay attention to it before stating off the journey (especially when female travelers are included).
                    </li>
                    <li>Ease of accessibility or lack thereof is also a factor that can sway the decision of visiting a destination or not. Generally, the popular destinations have a lot of daily flights, trains, and good highway infrastructure to support the tourist influx.
